# Wunderlist 2 Print Bookmarklet

The new Wunderlist 2 does not offer (optimized) print support at the moment. Until this feature goes life within the next releases, you can use this bookmarklet to get a decent looking print version.

## How to:

See [fabianbeiner.github.com/Wunderlist-2-Print-Bookmarklet/](http://fabianbeiner.github.com/Wunderlist-2-Print-Bookmarklet/) for installation.

## Turns this:

## Into this:

(The red bar on top won't be printed, of course. It allows you to refresh the page to the original layout.)
